The concept of walkingpapers in one sentence:

Print maps on special "walkingpaper," draw on them, scan them back in and help OpenStreetMap improve its coverage of local points of interests and street detail.

By contrast, the concept of talkingpapers: 

Print surveys on "talkingpaper," get people to answer them, scan your results and automatically synch all of your results, even when you change the survery questions.
 

 =========================
 = talkingpapers defined =
 =========================

Talkingpapers are forms that contain special encoded information about the form that you are editing. The paper, by virtue of it's barcodes, contains all of the information about the schma that it represents. It also uses a OCR friendly format known as "those annoying bubble blocks invented by the IRS." This combination of machine readable (ORC) and machine understandable (encoded schema) permits faster and more reliable data transfer. 

By scanning the paper with talkingpapers reader, you can

UN humanitarian community: clusters, eg, nutritioncluster healthcluster secutirycluster ...
Different organizations have different responsibilities and based on what they known from reports on the ground, so they will do an assessment -- a form. We want to make the forms smarter.

In this case the form-maker is concerned with "relief data"
- critical infrastructure
- condition of the health standpoint
- water and sanitation

These data points are gathered as quickly as possible in order to make actionable conclusions about where to send relief, and how to send it. 

There also are many questions you didn't know to ask. 

Essentially looking at needs and loking at it to proporitize different types of need. 

- All of these operational responses are driven by data.
- All are driven by technology. 
- Information is the oxygen of all of these opeations
- that's why mobile tools have exploded. 

Logistics officer: needs to get things from point a to point be in the maximum way (balance of supplies, saftey.)
- what are the supply needs. 
- what kinds of routes are open
- is sombody gonna kill us if we go to the well?

- registering everyone at a camp.
- designing living conditions for people in really shitty circumstances.
- aid agencies are starved for data for the response effort.
- victims are their own first responders.


 ====================
 = EXAMPLE USE CASE =
 ====================

IE in pakistan: You are a relief worker. You are talking to people who need your help. You need to know: does your land even exist? are you scared to go back? why? 

All of the UN groups ask a similar set of questions (a schema/model/ontology is represented in forms): 

- do you have pregnant women? 
- do you have any minors. 
- Some of the data will vary a lot more than the others.

 ===========================
 = Post-Distaster Timeline =
 ===========================

We move increasingly from the point of diaster outbreak toward the completion of the relief. At the beginning the data is produced and consumed from far away, and then it moves closer to the ground. 

We would also like to design for the people who are helping themselves in the relief effort (ie, everyone in the crisis.) 

In a typical diaster relief effort, there are a number of actors responsible for the following tasks: 


We imagine two people surveying an area in a disaster relief situation giving increasingly meaningful data back to a centralized actor. 50 of these teams could cover a state and provide a more accurate survey than any other team of 50 -- because our schemas are more flexible, both in their constrution and execution. 

The goal of the project is to create a powerful, simpler type of crisis data. Data gathered using surveys is frequently the basis of large scale relief efforts. 

The logistics of a relief effort, like all logistics, is governed by data. 

Increasingly, our mode of gathering data is based on digital methods, but lack adapters that permit backward compatibility with previous, more stable forms of technology. We believe that there is an important role for paper in humanitarian crisis relief data, such as the conditions of road, the presence or absence of populations

This data is traditionally ruled by large instutions, but there is a

- Some of the questions have to change.
- Some of the questions you *do not have on the form yet* are essential.
- you are collecting something and the metadata is constantly evolving. 
- the populating has moved on from needing water to needing something much more. You need to be able to respong d in realtime.

The forms are manually entered. carried over USB over land and then imported into the database.

We need paper. Not Piles and piles of it laying around gathering dust. And not the manual transription part. But we need data.

Data transition points in the crisis ecosystem RUIN data -- most prone to errors in transcriptions. 

Resulting mentality, perhaps: "you are not changing any of my schemas."

People who aren't even half fluent in the language are administering the questions.

we could create a new kind of humanitarian data stream. not fancier. better. 

raise paper to a more sophisticated instrument. 

ah paper. the misery that I have seen in the field. It takes days to arrive. 

you can see the pain ithat people have gone through. 

try to prevalidate it. 

so you get some errors
 and you can't work with it. 
 
we dont have the backend. 
we don't have the proceses in place.

A page that represents the idea and who we are designing it for, to get some understanding of what we are talking about. Then get people who have ideas for how this could be used in other ways, or feedback on what robert is sayin, perhaps they will say "robert is on crack." We should find out.

We already have a jpeg converter, we need to build something first that can be put together in a week. We could use the drupal form builder, but nobody really likes using drupal. We could prototype it with drupal and move away from it.

Xforms? Does not seem very 
I would love to build something with xforms: but it is not the right way to build a form for the humanitarian space.

We can't validate on a piece of paper. yet.
