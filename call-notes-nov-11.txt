that's why mobile tools have exploded. 

so information is treated with equal priority. 



WHO IS IT FOR?

- what kinds of routes are open

designing for people in some circumstances


people are creating forms


Where are the metrics being taken from: potentially far away from the scene (increasingly close though). By a week after the event we can consider using the tool for much deeper studies. 


What you typically find is that the information you need is constanly 


"you are not changing any of my schemas."

you are collecting something and the metadata is constantly evolving. 

the populating has moved on from needing water to needing something much more. You need to be able to respong d in realtime.

The forms are manually entered. carried over USB over land and then imported into the database. 

most of the time that the chance you are sitting in the tent scrubbing they

People who aren't even half fluent


XML was created in 1996 we recognized it literslly contains everyting that a machine needs to knmow about that information. 

the goal is to 


create a form and hand out 100

if you could design a form that was inherently 

we could create a new kind of humanitarian data stream. not fancier. better. 

raise paper to a more sophisticated instrument. 

ah paper. the misery that I have seen in the field. It takes days to arrive. 

you can see the pain ithat people have gone through. 

try to prevalidate it. 

so you get some errors
 and you can't work with it. 
 
we dont have the backend. 
we don't have the proceses in place. 

desperate for good data. desperate for accurate data.

I can make a page that represents the idea and who we are designing it for.

Then get people who have ideas for how this could be used in other ways, or feedback on what robert is sayin "robert is on crack."

How does the form builder widget work? 
I would love to build something with xforms: but it is not the right way to build a form.
